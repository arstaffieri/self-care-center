[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
I was able to get the CSS to look pretty good, even though it doesn't look exactly like the comp. I think it's quite pretty. I was also able to get the image to disappear and the messages to display.
